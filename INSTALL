=== Debian

The recommended procedure is to use Debian apt on all machines.

  * apt-get install rq-ruby1.8

which resolves dependencies, or 

  * dpkg -i rq-ruby1.8-ver.deb

=== NFS central

The second option is to build and install once and distribute through
NFS. Use the tgz installation, which includes an ./all/ directory. On 
modern systems your mileage may vary as the Ruby build breaks on gcc 
version >4.4

  * Unpack rq-ver.tgz file
  
  * cd into ./all/

  * ./install.sh /full/path/to/a/nfs/mounted/directory/

  * the nfs mounted path above should be visible by all cluster nodes.
    __all__ required software will be installed into this directory root. when
    complete all that's needed is a

      export PATH=/full/path/to/a/nfs/mounted/directory/bin:$PATH

    (note 'bin') to use rq

  * this is the second best procedure since it will result in a single nfs
    install which all cluster nodes can use. The other install methods mean
    you will have to install rq on __each__ node you plan to use it on.

=== RUBYGEMS

(currently defunct, awaits updating rq to Ruby 1.9.x and sqlite3)

  * gem install rq

=== STANDARD

(in rq version <=3.4.0)

  * install all packages in ./depends/packages manually

  * ruby install.rb
