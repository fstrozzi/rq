=== Rubygems

The current version of rq runs on ruby1.8.

=== Debian

On Debian systems, the recommended procedure is to use Debian apt on all 
machines. For now, use the 3.4.2 install, as documented in the README!

(below will become available later)

  * apt-get install rq-ruby1.8

which resolves all dependencies, or alternatively 

  * Download the rq deb file from http://bio4.dnsalias.net/download/Debian/
  * apt-get install libposixlock-ruby1.8 libsqlite3-ruby1.8 ruby1.8 
  * dpkg --force-architecture -i rq-ruby1.8-ver.deb

which works on on 32-bits and 64-bits systems. The commands

  * rq ~/queue create
  * rq ~/queue status

should show

        jobs: 
          pending: 0
          holding: 0
          running: 0
          finished: 0
          dead: 0
          total: 0
        temporal: {}
        performance: 
          avg_time_per_job: 00h00m00.00s
          n_jobs_in_last_hrs: 
            1: 0
            12: 0
            24: 0
        exit_status: 
          successes: 0
          failures: 0
          ok: 0

=== NFS central

The second option is to build and install once and distribute through
NFS. Use the tgz installation, which includes an ./all/ directory. On 
modern systems your mileage may vary as the Ruby build breaks on gcc 
version >4.4

  * Unpack rq-ver.tgz file
  
  * cd into ./all/

  * ./install.sh /full/path/to/a/nfs/mounted/directory/

  * the nfs mounted path above should be visible by all cluster nodes.
    __all__ required software will be installed into this directory root. when
    complete all that's needed is a

      export PATH=/full/path/to/a/nfs/mounted/directory/bin:$PATH

    (note 'bin') to use rq

  * this is the second best procedure since it will result in a single nfs
    install which all cluster nodes can use. The other install methods mean
    you will have to install rq on __each__ node you plan to use it on.

=== RUBYGEMS

(currently defunct, awaits updating rq to Ruby 1.9.x and sqlite3)

  * gem install rq

=== STANDARD

(in rq version <=3.4.0)

  * install all packages in ./depends/packages manually

  * ruby install.rb
